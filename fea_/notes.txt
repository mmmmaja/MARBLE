Discretization:
In this step, you divide your robotic arm into a finite number of elements.
You need to create nodes at the junction of these elements.
Each node will have its own physical properties, such as position,
velocity, acceleration, and forces acting on it.


Formulate Element Stiffness Relations:
For each element, you need to derive the relationship between displacements (deformation) and forces.
This is typically done using Hooke's law for simple elastic materials,
but can get much more complex for different material properties and conditions.

Assemble Global Stiffness Matrix:
The stiffness matrix is a matrix that represents the relationships
between all the nodes and elements in the system. It is typically sparse (lots of zeros)
due to each node only interacting directly with its neighboring nodes.

Apply Boundary Conditions:
These are the constraints of your system.
For example, a node might be fixed in place (like the base of the arm),
or have a certain force applied (like a motor torque at a joint).

Solve the System of Equations:
Once you have the stiffness matrix and boundary conditions,
you can solve for the displacements of all nodes in the system using a variety of numerical techniques.
